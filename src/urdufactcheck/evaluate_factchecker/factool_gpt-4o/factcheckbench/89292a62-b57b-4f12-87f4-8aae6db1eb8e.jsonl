The first evidence suggests that domesticated cattle may have arrived from the Near East as early as 7,800 years ago, while another evidence suggests that domesticated cattle arrived in Africa around 6,000 BCE (approximately 8,000 years ago). However, there is also a claim that cattle were independently domesticated in northeastern Africa around 10,000 years ago. The text's timeframe of 8,000 to 7,000 years ago is consistent with the evidence of cattle arriving from the Near East, but it does not account for the possibility of earlier independent domestication in Africa.
