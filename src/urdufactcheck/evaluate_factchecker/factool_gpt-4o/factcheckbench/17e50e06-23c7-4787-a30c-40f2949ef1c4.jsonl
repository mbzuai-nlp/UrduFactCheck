The provided evidences indicate that resin is used to bind the fiberglass cloth to the surfboard, providing strength, durability, and a glossy finish. Additionally, one of the evidences mentions that a catalyst can be used to make the resin harden. This implies that resin does indeed play a role in the hardening process of a surfboard, as it is part of the curing process that solidifies the resin, thus contributing to the hardening of the surfboard.
