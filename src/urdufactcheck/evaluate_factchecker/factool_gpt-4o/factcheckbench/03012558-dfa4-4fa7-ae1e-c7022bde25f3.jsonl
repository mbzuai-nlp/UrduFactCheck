However, the provided evidences indicate that a star's apparent brightness depends on its luminosity and its distance from Earth. Luminosity is indeed related to the energy output of a star, which can be influenced by its mass, but the text oversimplifies the concept by not mentioning the role of distance in apparent brightness.
