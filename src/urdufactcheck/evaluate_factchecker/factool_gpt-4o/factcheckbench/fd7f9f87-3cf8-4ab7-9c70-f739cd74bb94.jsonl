The majority of the provided evidences support this claim, indicating that gold does not react with hydrochloric acid due to its properties as a noble metal. Specifically, evidences 1, 2, and 4 confirm that there is no reaction between gold and hydrochloric acid. Although evidence 3 mentions a chemical equation, it does not provide any details or contradict the other evidences. Evidence 5 and 6 discuss gold's reaction with aqua regia, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, not hydrochloric acid alone.
