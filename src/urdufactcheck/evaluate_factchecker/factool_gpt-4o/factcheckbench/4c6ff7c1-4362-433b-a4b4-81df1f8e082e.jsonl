The evidences suggest that epigenetic inheritance involves mechanisms beyond the DNA sequence itself, such as epigenetic tags and modifications that can be passed down generations. Evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, but rather involve alterations in gene expression. This suggests that while DNA packaging and regulation methods may play a role, the statement that epigenetic inheritance is 'coded' in these methods is misleading.
