The evidences provided indicate that ECharts supports various types of charts, including line series, but there is no specific mention of 'Java line charts' as a supported feature. Additionally, one of the evidences mentions ECharts Java as a library for Java developers to use Apache ECharts, which is a JavaScript library. This suggests that while ECharts can be used in Java applications through a library, the support is not specifically for 'Java line charts' but rather for integrating ECharts into Java applications.
