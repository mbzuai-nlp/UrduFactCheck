The evidences provided do not directly address the cost of dining at Geranium compared to other restaurants in Copenhagen. However, one evidence mentions that Geranium offers a tasting menu priced at 2800 DDK / €375, which suggests it is quite expensive. There is no evidence provided that directly compares the cost of dining at Geranium with other restaurants in Copenhagen, such as The Alchemist, which is described as a high-investment restaurant. Without direct evidence comparing the prices, it is not possible to definitively state whether Geranium is the most expensive or not.
