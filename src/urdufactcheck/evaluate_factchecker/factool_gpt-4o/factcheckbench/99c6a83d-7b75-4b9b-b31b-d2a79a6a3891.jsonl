The evidences provided support this claim by indicating that an abacus does not require electricity or batteries to operate, which implies that it does not consume energy in the way electronic devices do. Although one evidence mentions power consumption in the context of an 'abacus adder,' this is likely referring to a specific electronic implementation rather than a traditional abacus.
