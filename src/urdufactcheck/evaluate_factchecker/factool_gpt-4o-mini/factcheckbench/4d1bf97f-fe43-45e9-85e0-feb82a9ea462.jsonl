However, the provided evidences indicate that stars form primarily through the contraction of gas and dust under gravity. The first evidence describes star formation as the contraction of a large cloud of gas and dust, while the second evidence explains that the first stars formed from hydrogen gas, which then fused into helium and lithium in their cores.
