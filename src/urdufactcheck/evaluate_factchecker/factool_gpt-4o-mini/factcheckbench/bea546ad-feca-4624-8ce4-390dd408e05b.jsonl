The provided evidences support this claim, as multiple sources indicate that there is no reaction between gold and hydrochloric acid. Specifically, the evidences mention that gold does not react with hydrochloric acid due to its noble metal properties, and there is no chemical equation for such a reaction. Although one evidence mentions a reaction involving hydrochloric acid, it refers to aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which is not the same as hydrochloric acid alone.
