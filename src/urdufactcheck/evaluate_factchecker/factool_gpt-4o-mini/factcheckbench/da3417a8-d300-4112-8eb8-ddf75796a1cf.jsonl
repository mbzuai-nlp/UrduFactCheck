The provided evidences support this claim by indicating that the abacus does not require electricity or batteries to operate, which implies that it does not consume energy in the way electronic devices do. Although one evidence mentions power consumption in the context of an 'abacus adder,' this seems to refer to a specific technological application rather than the traditional abacus.
