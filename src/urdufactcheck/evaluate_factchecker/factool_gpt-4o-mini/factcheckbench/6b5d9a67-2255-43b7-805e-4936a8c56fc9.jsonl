The evidences provided give varying figures for cashmere production, which is often referred to as Kashmiri wool. Some evidences suggest that the annual production of raw cashmere is between 15,000 and 20,000 metric tons, while others suggest a range of 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons. However, there are also evidences indicating that the production of cashmere is between 4,000 and 10,000 metric tons annually, and another evidence suggests approximately 6,500 metric tons of pure cashmere.
