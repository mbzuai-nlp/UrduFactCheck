The provided evidences do not directly address the terminology of 'standard air' in scuba diving. However, the first evidence describes the composition of the air used in scuba diving as being about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, which aligns with the composition of atmospheric air. This suggests that the term 'standard air' could be used to refer to compressed atmospheric air used in scuba diving. The second evidence discusses the process of compressing air for diving, which involves filtration to ensure safety, but does not contradict the notion of 'standard air.' Therefore, based on the provided evidences, there is no indication that the term 'standard air' is factually incorrect in this context.", "error": "None", "correction": "None", "factuality": true, "claim": "Compressed air in scuba diving is known as standard air.", "evidences": [["What is standard air in scuba diving?
