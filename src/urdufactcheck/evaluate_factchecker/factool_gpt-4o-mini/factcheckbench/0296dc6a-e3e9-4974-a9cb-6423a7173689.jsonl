The first evidence suggests that domesticated cattle may have arrived from the Near East as early as 7,800 years ago, while another evidence suggests that domesticated cattle arrived in Africa around 6,000 BCE (approximately 8,000 years ago) from the Middle East. However, there is also a claim that inhabitants of northeastern Africa may have domesticated cattle independently around 10,000 years ago. The text's claim of domestication beginning 8,000 to 7,000 years ago aligns with the evidence of cattle arriving from the Near East around 7,800 years ago, but it does not account for the possibility of earlier independent domestication in Africa 10,000 years ago.
