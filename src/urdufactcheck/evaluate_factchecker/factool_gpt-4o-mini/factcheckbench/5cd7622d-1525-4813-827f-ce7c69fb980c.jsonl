The evidences suggest that while black holes themselves do not emit light, there has been a suspected flare of light associated with the merger of two black holes. However, this light is not directly from the merger itself but possibly from the surrounding material affected by the merger. The evidence indicates that this phenomenon is not yet confirmed as a common occurrence and would be the first known instance if verified.
