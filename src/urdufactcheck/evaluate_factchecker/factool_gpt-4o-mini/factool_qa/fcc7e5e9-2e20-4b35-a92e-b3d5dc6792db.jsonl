The provided evidences suggest that fortune cookies likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants in the United States, with a specific mention of Makoto Hagiwara introducing them in 1914 at the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco. While the concept originated in Japan, the specific serving of fortune cookies as we know them today is linked to Japanese immigrants in the U.S., not directly to Japanese tea shops in Japan.
