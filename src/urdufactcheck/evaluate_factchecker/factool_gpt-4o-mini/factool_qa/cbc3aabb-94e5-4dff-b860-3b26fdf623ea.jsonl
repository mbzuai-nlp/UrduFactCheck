One evidence mentions that most Amtrak trains in the US travel between 110 and 145 miles per hour, while European trains can go even faster, with some reaching speeds of 360 km/h (approximately 224 mph) and capable of reaching 575 km/h (approximately 357 mph), although they are not operated at that speed. Another evidence states that European trains achieve speeds of at least 100 - 125 mph, with basic speeds of 80 mph being common, which aligns with the speeds mentioned for US trains. Additionally, it is noted that the US passenger train system is underdeveloped compared to Europe's.
