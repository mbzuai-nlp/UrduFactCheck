The provided evidences support this claim by explaining that dogs have only two types of cones in their retinas, compared to humans who have three. This difference in the number of cone types results in dogs having poorer color perception, specifically a dichromatic vision that limits them to discerning blue and yellow, whereas humans can perceive a broader range of colors.
